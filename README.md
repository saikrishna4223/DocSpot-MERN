# DocSpot-MERN
DocSpot is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application for managing online medical appointments. It enables patients to find and book appointments with doctors, doctors to manage their consultations, and admins to handle user approvals and system monitoring — all from dedicated role-based dashboards.
